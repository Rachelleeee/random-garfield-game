# random-garfield-game
game i made for some reason


There are two WAV files that are not included cause they were too big
"fireflies.WAV" and "colada.WAV"
replace with whatever u want

fireflies is the song throughout the game, colada is the end song.

Also, all the art is by me except for the background. I cant draw backgrounds.

EDIT: 
make sure to download the sound library for processing 
(sketch -> import library -> add library -> search sound)
